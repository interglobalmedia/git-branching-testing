    <title>Git Branching Testing</title>

<body>
    <p>I created this repository to test whether the creation of a new branch, checking into it, committing its contents
        locally, pushing to remote origin, checking out of it and back into master, merging the contents of the new
        branch into master, and then pushing it to remote is successful.</p>
